# Sprint 1 Meeting Agenda
1. What is the primary goal of the app?
2. What are the basic requirements that our app needs to solve?
    - A page listing all the current tariffs
    - A page where people can calculate the effect of the tariff on their imports
        - Maybe also show what tariffs are applied and why
3. Who are our target user group?
    - Is it business owners importing goods?
    - Is it governments? So they can analyse the effect of tariffs
    - Users as a curiosity? Or to verify the news of a new tariff?
4. How should we scope our project?
    - What features do you think we NEED inside the app
        - What features are non-negotiable, 100% needed in the app
        - What types of devices are going to use our app?
    - What features do you think we should NOT implement?
        - Maybe autosaving might be too hard if there’s no API we can use
        - What optional requirements are we going to ignore?
5. How should we split our development?
    - Who takes what type of role/responsibility
        - Can decide based on experience or by choice
6. How should we delegate roles and respoinsibilities?
    - I’m thinking we can have teams of 2-3 working on a substantial part of the application (eg. front-end UI of a webpage which interacts with the backend)
        - One guy can do styling and one guy can do backend work
    - SCRUM Master aka Project Manager?
        - I think we need a point of contact, where one guy knows what’s going on across all of us.
    - Code Review can be done by either a designated person, group of people, or another team depending on complexity and resources
7. What are we going to use to make this project?
    - What do we need to use?
        - Springboot
    - Are there better solutions that are out there?
    - What are the justifications for a specific part of the stack?
8. General processes relating to development
    - Pull request utilization
    - Branches
    - What checks need to be implemented
    d. Testing mechanism
    e. Someone could be on call to sort out these types of issues (Could also be the main guy doing code review)?
9. What do we need to sort out before next class?
    - Set-up everyone’s development enviornment?
    - What can we get started on now?
